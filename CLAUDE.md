# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Node/pnpm are installed via Homebrew and not in the default PATH. Always prefix shell commands with:
```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$PATH"
```

```bash
pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit   # TypeScript check
pnpm test                 # Vitest unit tests (one-shot)
pnpm test:watch           # Vitest watch mode
pnpm seed                 # Seed curriculum data into Supabase (requires env vars)
```

Seed command requires env vars:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... pnpm seed
```
Re-seeding duplicates rows — truncate `exercises`, `concepts`, `units`, `modules` first.

## Git / GitHub Workflow

After every meaningful change or completed work step:
1. Stage specific files (never `git add -A` blindly)
2. Commit with a clear conventional message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` etc.)
3. Push to `origin main` (`git push origin main`)

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 16** (App Router, `src/` layout, TypeScript, Server + Client Components)
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Auth + RLS (no Supabase CLI; migrations run manually in SQL editor)
- **Claude API** (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) — grades every exercise response; no user self-rating
- **shadcn/ui** + Tailwind v4 (Neutral theme)
- **recharts** — progress analytics charts
- **Vitest** + **@testing-library/react** — unit + component tests (`src/**/__tests__/`)
- **pnpm** — package manager

### Key Dependency Constraints
- `zod` pinned to **v3** — do NOT upgrade; v4 breaks `@hookform/resolvers@4`
- Supabase types are hand-written in `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` (not CLI-generated). Every table must have a `Relationships: []` array or the SDK types all columns as `never`. After any `.select()` / `.single()`, always cast: `data as MyType`.

### Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

### Route Map
| Route | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Server | Redirects → `/dashboard` or `/auth/login` |
| `/auth/login` `/auth/signup` | Client | Email/password auth forms |
| `/auth/callback` | Route handler | Supabase OAuth code exchange |
| `/onboarding` | Server + Client | 6-question diagnostic for new users; seeds SRS on completion |
| `/dashboard` | Server | Due count, streak, mastered count, progress bar, quick-nav |
| `/study` | Server + Client | Study session — queue fetched server-side, state machine client-side |
| `/study/configure` | Server + Client | Session config — pick module + exercise types before starting |
| `/curriculum` | Server | Full concept tree with mastery badges; all concepts/units/modules are clickable |
| `/progress` | Server + Client | MasteryChart, AccuracyChart, ActivityHeatmap |
| `/tutor` | Server + Client | Streaming AI chat; accepts `?concept=<id>` for context |
| `POST /api/submit` | Route handler | Grade answer → SM-2 → upsert `user_progress` → insert `exercise_attempts` → update streak |
| `POST /api/hint` | Route handler | Claude-generated worked example for stuck users |
| `POST /api/chat` | Route handler | Streaming tutor chat (plain text ReadableStream) |
| `POST /api/onboarding/complete` | Route handler | Bulk SRS seed from diagnostic scores → set `onboarding_completed = true` |
| `POST /api/sessions/complete` | Route handler | Insert `study_sessions` row with timing + accuracy |

### Middleware Rules (`src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`)
- Unauthenticated → redirect to `/auth/login` (except `/auth/*`)
- Authenticated + `onboarding_completed = false` → redirect to `/onboarding`
  - **API routes (`/api/*`) are excluded from this redirect** — they must never be redirected to a page
- Both checks skip `/auth/*`

### Study Session Query Params (`/study`)
| Param | Effect |
|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Default SRS due queue for today |
| `?concept=<id>` | Practice a single concept (ignores due date) |
| `?unit=<id>` | All concepts in a unit |
| `?module=<id>` | All concepts in a module |
| `?types=gap_fill,translation,...` | Filter exercises by type (comma-separated) |

Session configure page (`/study/configure`) builds these params via a UI before redirecting to `/study`.

### Exercise Types & Components
| Type | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gap_fill` | `GapFill.tsx` | Single-line input |
| `transformation` `translation` `free_write` | `TextAnswer.tsx` | Multi-line textarea |
| `sentence_builder` | `SentenceBuilder.tsx` | Word chip bank; parses `[w1/w2/w3]` tokens from prompt |
| `error_correction` | `ErrorCorrection.tsx` | Extracts `"quoted sentence"` from prompt, pre-populates textarea with warning |

All routed through `ExerciseRenderer` switch in `StudySession.tsx`.

### Core Learning Loop
1. `StudySession.tsx` state: `answering → feedback → [try again | next] → done`
2. `POST /api/submit` — Claude grades → SM-2 update → DB writes → streak update (once per day)
3. `POST /api/sessions/complete` — fired (fire-and-forget) when session ends; writes `study_sessions` row
4. `src/lib/srs/index.ts` — pure `sm2(progress, score)` function; scores 0–3 from Claude only
5. New users auto-bootstrapped with 5 easiest concepts on first visit (unless onboarding seeded SRS)

### Streak Logic
- Updated in `POST /api/submit` on the **first submission of each calendar day**
- If `last_studied_date == yesterday` → `streak + 1`
- If gap > 1 day (or null) → `streak = 1`
- If `last_studied_date == today` → no-op (already counted)
- Stored in `profiles.streak` and `profiles.last_studied_date`

### Hint System
Wrong attempt 1 → shows `hint_1`. Wrong attempt 2 → shows `hint_2`. Wrong attempt 3+ → "Show worked example" button → calls `POST /api/hint` → Claude generates a fresh example. Resets on each new exercise.

### AI Tutor
- `src/lib/claude/tutor.ts` — `buildTutorSystemPrompt(ctx)` injects user name, level, current concept, up to 5 recent error feedbacks
- `POST /api/chat` streams plain text chunks; client reads via `response.body.getReader()`
- `TutorChat.tsx` appends tokens to the last assistant message as they arrive

### Supabase Clients
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client (`'use client'` components)
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client (Server Components + Route Handlers)
- `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — session refresh + auth/onboarding gating, consumed by `src/middleware.ts`

All routes except `/auth/*` redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth/login`. Profile auto-created on signup via `handle_new_user` Postgres trigger.

### Database Schema
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | One row per user; `streak`, `last_studied_date`, `onboarding_completed` |
| `modules / units / concepts / exercises` | Curriculum hierarchy (publicly readable) |
| `user_progress` | SRS state per user+concept (`ease_factor`, `interval_days`, `due_date`, `repetitions`) |
| `exercise_attempts` | Full attempt history with AI score + feedback |
| `study_sessions` | Session analytics — written by `/api/sessions/complete` |

Migrations (run once in Supabase SQL editor):
- `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/002_onboarding_flag.sql`

### Dashboard Stats
- **Streak**: live from `profiles.streak` (updated on first daily submit)
- **Mastered**: `user_progress` rows where `interval_days >= 21` (matches curriculum mastery threshold)
- **Curriculum progress bar**: mastered / total concepts × 100%
- `isNewUser` flag uses `studiedCount` (any `user_progress` row), not `masteredCount`

### Curriculum Seed Content
- Module 1: Connectors & Discourse Markers (3 units: Concessive, Causal/Consecutive, Adversative)
- Module 2: Subjunctive Mastery (2 units: Present Triggers, Imperfect/Hypotheticals)
- 21 concepts, 2 exercises each = 42 exercises total
