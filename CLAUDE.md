### General comments

You are an Expert in Product Management work, Coding and UX Research, alongside being a world-class language teacher and learner who is really experienced in Spanish. Your job is to make a great app to help advanced Spanish learners go from B1 to B2 and eventually C1 through offering advanced exercises specifically targeted on active recall. We cover a market gap here as existing applications (DuoLingo, Babbel) offer too simplistic exercises not challenging enough and other solutions such as KwizIQ do not offer sufficient variation in exercises (most being multiple choice). Our Design has to be sleek and modern. The main usage point will be as an application on iOS and in the Browser (comparable to Babbel) - so we always need that cross-device functionality. No progress should ever be stored on the device, it should all live in the cloud.

- If you have questions for clarification that woud help improve your work, always ask them to the user before starting your work or edits.
- Always add Unit Tests for newly created features when writing them so we can test the application well.
- Keep a best in class code hygiene and syntax to make the code as easy to maintain as possible.
- BEFORE you commit or do any edits or changes, always activate plan mode, irrespective if the user has triggered it already or not to create an step-by-step implementation. Present the plan back to the user and only if confirmed then move ahead.

## Commands

Node/pnpm are installed via Homebrew and not in the default PATH. Always prefix shell commands with:

```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$PATH"
```

```bash
pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit   # TypeScript check
pnpm test                 # Vitest unit tests (one-shot)
pnpm test:watch           # Vitest watch mode
pnpm seed                 # Seed curriculum data into Supabase (requires env vars)
pnpm annotate             # Annotate exercises with grammatical spans via Claude (requires env vars)
pnpm seed:ai              # Generate new concepts + top-up existing → docs/curriculum-review-YYYY-MM-DD.json
pnpm seed:ai:apply        # Apply approved entries from review JSON to Supabase
pnpm seed:verbs           # Generate verb sentences via Claude Haiku → docs/verb-sentences-YYYY-MM-DD.json
pnpm seed:verbs:apply     # Insert verb_sentences rows from review JSON
pnpm validate:grading     # ARCH-02 offline validation: grade 50 attempts with Haiku vs Sonnet baseline
pnpm push:keygen          # Generate VAPID key pair for push notifications
```

Post-deploy API smoke check (requires env vars):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... pnpm exec tsx scripts/smoke-test.ts
```

Seed command requires env vars:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... pnpm seed
```

Re-seeding duplicates rows — truncate `exercises`, `concepts`, `units`, `modules` first.

Annotate command requires env vars:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... pnpm annotate
```

Annotates all exercises where `annotations IS NULL`; safe to re-run (skips already-annotated rows).

Seed:ai command requires env vars:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... pnpm seed:ai
```

Queries DB for existing exercise counts; generates missing exercises for new and existing concepts; writes review JSON to `docs/`. Set `_approved: true` on entries, then run `pnpm seed:ai:apply [--dry-run] <file>`.

Seed:verbs command requires env vars:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... pnpm seed:verbs
```

Inserts 50 verbs into `verbs` table, then generates 3 sentences per verb × tense (350 combos) via Claude Haiku. Resume-safe — skips combos already written. Then run `pnpm seed:verbs:apply [--dry-run] <file>`. Idempotent — skips combos already in DB.

## Git / GitHub Workflow

After every meaningful change or completed work step:

1. Stage specific files (never `git add -A` blindly)
2. Commit with a clear conventional message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` etc.)
3. Push to `origin main` (`git push origin main`)

Remote: `https://github.com/Nicolas2892/LanguageApp.git`

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, `src/` layout, TypeScript, Server + Client Components)
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Auth + RLS (no Supabase CLI; migrations run manually in SQL editor)
- **Claude API** — `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (TUTOR_MODEL) for tutor + exercise generation; `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (GRADE_MODEL) for grading + hints (validated 93.8% score agreement vs Sonnet)
- **shadcn/ui** + Tailwind v4 (Neutral theme)
- **recharts** — progress analytics charts
- **Vitest** + **@testing-library/react** — unit + component tests (`src/**/__tests__/`)
- **pnpm** — package manager

### Key Dependency Constraints

- `zod` pinned to **v3** — do NOT upgrade; v4 breaks `@hookform/resolvers@4`
- Supabase types are hand-written in `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` (not CLI-generated). Every table must have a `Relationships: []` array or the SDK types all columns as `never`. After any `.select()` / `.single()`, always cast: `data as MyType`.
- Do NOT use join syntax (e.g. `verbs(id, infinitive)`) in `.select()` calls for tables with `Relationships: []` — the SDK returns `SelectQueryError`. Fetch related data in a separate query and join in TypeScript.

### Middleware Rules (`src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`)

- Unauthenticated → redirect to `/auth/login` (except `/auth/*`)
- Authenticated + `onboarding_completed = false` → redirect to `/onboarding`
  - **API routes (`/api/`*) are excluded from this redirect** — they must never be redirected to a page
- Both checks skip `/auth/`*

### Study Session Query Params (`/study`)


| Param                                      | Effect                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *(none)*                                   | Default SRS due queue for today                                                                                 |
| `?practice=true`                           | **Open Practice** — full catalog, no SRS due-date gate; guarantees ≥ MIN_PRACTICE_SIZE exercises via cycling    |
| `?practice=true&concept=<id>`              | Open Practice for a single concept (≥ 5 exercises, cycling)                                                     |
| `?practice=true&concept=<id>&types=<type>` | Narrow drill mode — all exercises of type; enables AI generation                                                |
| `?practice=true&unit=<id>`                 | Open Practice for all concepts in a unit                                                                        |
| `?practice=true&module=<id>`               | Open Practice for all concepts in a module                                                                      |
| `?concept=<id>`                            | Falls through to SRS default — use `practice=true&concept=<id>` for open practice                               |
| `?unit=<id>`                               | All concepts in a unit (SRS path)                                                                               |
| `?module=<id>`                             | All concepts in a module (SRS path)                                                                             |
| `?types=gap_fill,translation,...`          | Filter exercises by type (comma-separated)                                                                      |
| `?mode=new`                                | Unlearned concepts queue (not in `user_progress`), ordered by difficulty; redirects `/dashboard` if none remain |
| `?mode=review`                             | Mistake review — most-recent failed attempt per concept (score ≤ 1)                                             |
| `?mode=sprint`                             | Sprint mode — SRS due queue with time or count cap; see `limitType` + `limit` params                            |


Session configure page (`/study/configure`) builds these params via a UI before redirecting to `/study`. Three modes: **SRS Review**, **Open Practice**, **Review mistakes**. Pre-selects Open Practice when `?mode=practice` is in the configure URL (e.g. from "Practice anyway" on dashboard).

### Verb Session Query Params (`/verbs/session`)


| Param     | Values                                     | Effect                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `tenses`  | comma-separated tense keys                 | Which tenses to drill                  |
| `verbSet` | `favorites` | `top25` | `top50` | `top100` | `single` | Which verbs to draw sentences from     |
| `verb`    | infinitive string                          | Used when `verbSet=single`             |

| `hint`    | `1`                                        | Show `[infinitive]` hint next to blank |


### Exercise Types & Components


| Type                                        | Component             | Notes                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gap_fill`                                  | `GapFill.tsx`         | Single-line input; SpeakButton wired                                                |
| `transformation` `translation` `free_write` | `TextAnswer.tsx`      | Multi-line textarea; SpeakButton wired                                              |
| `sentence_builder`                          | `SentenceBuilder.tsx` | Word chip bank; parses `[w1/w2/w3]` tokens from prompt; SpeakButton wired           |
| `error_correction`                          | `ErrorCorrection.tsx` | Extracts `"quoted sentence"` from prompt, pre-populates textarea; SpeakButton wired |
| `free_write` (write page)                   | `FreeWritePrompt.tsx` | SpeakButton + STT mic dictation (Web Speech API, es-ES)                             |


All routed through shared `ExerciseRenderer` in `src/components/exercises/ExerciseRenderer.tsx`.

### Core Learning Loop

1. `StudySession.tsx` state: `answering → feedback → [try again | next] → done`
2. `POST /api/submit` — Claude grades → SM-2 update → DB writes → streak update (once per day)
3. `POST /api/sessions/complete` — fired (fire-and-forget) when session ends; writes `study_sessions` row
4. `src/lib/srs/index.ts` — pure `sm2(progress, score)` function; scores 0–3 from Claude only
5. New users auto-bootstrapped with 5 easiest concepts on first visit (unless onboarding seeded SRS)

### Verb Conjugation Loop

1. `VerbSession.tsx` state: `answering → feedback → [try again | next] → done`
2. Grading is **local** — `gradeConjugation()` in `src/lib/verbs/grader.ts`; zero Claude cost
3. Three outcomes: `correct` (auto-advance 1.5s, green flash) · `accent_error` (orange flash, manual Next) · `incorrect` (red flash, Try Again or Next)
4. Fire-and-forget `POST /api/verbs/grade` records attempt in `verb_progress` via `increment_verb_progress` RPC
5. Session done screen shows overall % + per-tense breakdown sorted worst-first

### Streak Logic

- Updated in `POST /api/submit` on the **first submission of each calendar day**
- If `last_studied_date == yesterday` → `streak + 1`
- If gap > 1 day (or null) → `streak = 1`
- If `last_studied_date == today` → no-op (already counted)
- Stored in `profiles.streak` and `profiles.last_studied_date`

### Hint System

`HintPanel` is gated behind `wrongAttempts > 0` — not rendered on first attempt (progressive disclosure). Wrong attempt 1 → shows `hint_1`. Wrong attempt 2 → shows `hint_2`. Wrong attempt 3+ → "Show worked example" button → calls `POST /api/hint` → Claude generates a fresh example. Resets on each new exercise.

### AI Tutor

- `src/lib/claude/tutor.ts` — `buildTutorSystemPrompt(ctx)` injects user name, level, current concept, up to 5 recent error feedbacks
- `POST /api/chat` streams plain text chunks; client reads via `response.body.getReader()`
- `TutorChat.tsx` appends tokens to the last assistant message as they arrive

### Supabase Clients

- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client (`'use client'` components)
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client (Server Components + Route Handlers)
- `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — session refresh + auth/onboarding gating, consumed by `src/middleware.ts`

All routes except `/auth/`* redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth/login`. Profile auto-created on signup via `handle_new_user` Postgres trigger.

### Database Schema


| Table                                    | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `profiles`                               | One row per user; `streak`, `last_studied_date`, `onboarding_completed`, `computed_level`, `skip_gap_fill`               |

Migrations (run once in Supabase SQL editor):

- `001–009`: initial schema, onboarding flag, indexes, exercise_id nullable, Google OAuth trigger fix, computed_level, grammar_focus, exercise annotations, push_subscription
- `supabase/migrations/010_theme_preference.sql` — `profiles.theme_preference text DEFAULT 'system'`
- `supabase/migrations/011_streak_rpc.sql` — `increment_streak_if_new_day(p_user_id uuid)` atomic RPC
- `supabase/migrations/012_push_due_count_rpc.sql` — `get_subscribers_with_due_counts(...)` RPC
- `supabase/migrations/013_hard_flag.sql` — `user_progress.is_hard boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`
- `supabase/migrations/014_verb_conjugation.sql` — `verbs`, `verb_sentences`, `user_verb_favorites`, `verb_progress` tables + `increment_verb_progress(p_user_id, p_verb_id, p_tense, p_correct)` RPC
- `supabase/migrations/015_verb_conjugations.sql` — `verb_conjugations` table (full 6-pronoun paradigm + stem per verb × tense)
- `supabase/migrations/016_is_admin.sql` — `profiles.is_admin boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`; run `UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = '<uuid>'` after applying

- `supabase/migrations/018_exercise_pool.sql` — `exercises.source text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'seed'` CHECK IN ('seed','ai_generated'); FK `exercise_attempts.exercise_id` changed to ON DELETE SET NULL

### Dashboard Stats

- **Streak**: live from `profiles.streak` (updated on first daily submit)
- **Mastered**: `user_progress` rows where `interval_days >= 21` (matches curriculum mastery threshold)
- **Curriculum progress bar**: mastered / total concepts × 100%
- `isNewUser` flag uses `studiedCount` (any `user_progress` row), not `masteredCount`
- **Sprint card removed** — Escritura Libre card is the primary deferred action on the dashboard
- Deferred section (`DashboardDeferredSection`) runs 6 queries in two parallelised batches; wrapped in `<Suspense>` with `DashboardDeferredSkeleton`; `WindingPathSeparator` only renders before Revisar Errores when that card is actually present

### Curriculum Seed Content

**Currently in DB** (100 concepts, 924 exercises):

- Module 1: Connectors & Discourse Markers — 4 units, 23 concepts
- Module 2a: The Subjunctive: Core — 1 unit, 5 concepts
- Module 2b: The Subjunctive: Advanced — 2 units, 8 concepts
- Module 3: Past Tenses — 3 units, 11 concepts
- Module 4: Core Spanish Contrasts — 3 units, 12 concepts
- Module 5: Verbal Periphrases — 3 units, 13 concepts
- Module 6: Complex Sentences — 3 units, 13 concepts
- Module 8: Conversational & Pragmatic Markers — 4 units, 15 concepts
- ~9 exercises per concept (3 per exercise type); 56/61 null-annotation exercises annotated
- Full plan: `src/lib/curriculum/curriculum-plan.ts` (100 concepts); design reference: `docs/curriculum-design.md`
- `pnpm seed:ai:apply` is now idempotent — skips concepts/exercises that already exist. Safe to re-run.

### Verb Seed Content

**Status: LIVE — migrations 014 + 015 applied, all seed data in DB**

- 100 verbs hard-coded in `src/lib/curriculum/run-seed-verbs.ts` (ranks 1–100)
- 9 tenses × 100 verbs × 3 sentences = 2,700 `verb_sentences` rows in DB
- 9 tenses × 100 verbs = 900 `verb_conjugations` rows in DB
- `pnpm seed:conjugations` — generates full 6-pronoun paradigm + stem per verb × tense via Claude Haiku → `docs/verb-conjugations-YYYY-MM-DD.json`; resume-safe
- `pnpm seed:conjugations:apply <file>` — upserts `verb_conjugations` rows; idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)

### D5 Design System

Art Direction 5 (D5) is the live brand. Key tokens and utilities defined in `src/app/globals.css`:

**Semantic palette tokens** (`:root`):
- `--d5-ink: #1A1108` — near-black heading colour
- `--d5-terracotta: #C4522E` — primary/CTA colour (maps to `--primary`)
- `--d5-warm: #8C6A3F` — mid-tone; body labels, nav inactive (light)
- `--d5-muted: #B8AA99` — muted; nav inactive (dark), pronoun cells
- `--d5-paper: #FDFCF9` — background / button foreground

**Adaptive tokens** (auto-swap in `.dark`):
- `--d5-eyebrow` — warm in light, muted in dark
- `--d5-separator` — warm in light, muted in dark (WindingPathSeparator stroke)
- `--d5-nav-inactive` — warm in light, muted in dark

**CSS utility classes**:
- `.senda-eyebrow` — 9px, bold, tracking 0.12em, uppercase, `var(--d5-eyebrow)`; font: Plus Jakarta
- `.senda-card` — warm tint fill `rgba(140,106,63,0.07)`, 20px radius, soft box-shadow, 16px 18px padding; dark override auto via `.dark .senda-card`
- `.senda-heading` — DM Serif Display italic, `var(--d5-ink)` / `var(--d5-paper)` in dark

**Rule:** Never hardcode `text-green-*` / `bg-green-*` for brand. Use `text-primary` / `bg-primary` / `border-primary` (all resolve to terracotta). Flash animations keep green/red/orange — they are semantic feedback signals.

**D5 shared SVG atoms**:
- `src/components/SvgSendaPath.tsx` — inline terracotta S-path; props: `size?` (default 20); used in SideNav + AppHeader wordmarks
- `src/components/WindingPathSeparator.tsx` — calligraphic SVG divider; uses `--d5-separator`; place between dashboard sections
- `src/components/BackgroundMagicS.tsx` — large watermark S-path (absolute positioned); parent must be `relative overflow-hidden`; props: `opacity?` (default 0.07)

### Key Shared Components & Utilities

- `src/lib/constants.ts` — SESSION_SIZE=10, BOOTSTRAP_SIZE=5, MASTERY_THRESHOLD=21, MIN_PRACTICE_SIZE=5, EXERCISE_CAP_PER_TYPE=15, LEVEL_CHIP, HARD_INTERVAL_MULTIPLIER=0.6
- `src/lib/practiceUtils.ts` — `cycleToMinimum(items, min)` pads Open Practice sessions to at least MIN_PRACTICE_SIZE; avoids consecutive duplicates when pool ≥ 2
- `src/lib/studyUtils.ts` — `biasedExercisePick(exercises, underweight)` (80% gap_fill exclusion in SRS) + `dropGapFillForPractice(items)` (~60% gap_fill drop in Open Practice)
- `src/lib/scoring.ts` — SCORE_CONFIG (score→label/colour map)
- `src/lib/verbs/constants.ts` — `TENSES`, `TENSE_LABELS` (Spanish names), `TENSE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `VerbTense` type
- `src/lib/verbs/grader.ts` — `normalizeSpanish(s)` + `gradeConjugation(userAnswer, correctForm, tenseRule)` → `VerbGradeResult`; pure functions, no network calls
- `src/lib/claude/client.ts` — anthropic client + TUTOR_MODEL + GRADE_MODEL constants
- `src/lib/hooks/useSpeech.ts` — TTS hook; `src/components/SpeakButton.tsx` — speaker button (wired in all 5 exercise types)
- `src/lib/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts` — STT hook (Web Speech API, es-ES, SSR-safe); `src/components/MicButton.tsx` — mic button used in FreeWritePrompt
- `src/components/exercises/ExerciseRenderer.tsx` — shared exercise switch
- `src/components/exercises/FreeWritePrompt.tsx` — AI prompt + textarea + SpeakButton + MicButton; used by WriteSession
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` — wraps StudySession, DiagnosticSession, WriteSession
- `src/components/HardFlagButton.tsx` — orange Flag icon; optimistic toggle with revert on failure; rate-limited via `/api/concepts/[id]/hard`
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` — `checkRateLimit(userId, routeKey, opts)` sliding-window (backed by @vercel/kv)
- `src/lib/api-utils.ts` — `updateStreakIfNeeded` + `updateComputedLevel` shared by submit + grade
- `src/components/verbs/VerbCard.tsx` — verb grid card with mastery dots + favorite button
- `src/components/verbs/VerbFavoriteButton.tsx` — optimistic heart toggle → `POST /api/verbs/favorite`
- `src/components/verbs/VerbFeedbackPanel.tsx` — correct / accent_error / incorrect feedback UI
- `src/components/verbs/VerbSummary.tsx` — session done screen with per-tense breakdown
- `src/components/verbs/VerbTenseMastery.tsx` — progress page section; accuracy bars per tense sorted worst-first

### Navigation

- **SideNav** (`src/components/SideNav.tsx`) — desktop sidebar (`hidden lg:flex`); D5 design: `SvgSendaPath` + DM Serif italic wordmark, left 3px terracotta accent bar per active item (no icons), `--d5-nav-inactive` for inactive items; 6 items: Dashboard → Study → Curriculum → Verbs → Progress → Tutor; hidden on `/auth`, `/onboarding`, `/brand-preview`, `/admin`
- **BottomNav** (`src/components/BottomNav.tsx`) — mobile 6-tab bar (`lg:hidden`); same order; active pill uses inline `rgba(184,170,153,0.28)` bg; `HIDDEN_ROUTES` includes `/verbs/session`
- **AppHeader** (`src/components/AppHeader.tsx`) — sticky mobile header (`lg:hidden`); `SvgSendaPath size={22}` + DM Serif italic "Senda" wordmark; hidden on `/auth`, `/study`, `/tutor`, `/onboarding`, `/brand-preview`

### CSS Animations & Skeleton

- `animate-flash-green` — correct answer flash (green-50 wash, 200ms)
- `animate-flash-red` — incorrect answer flash (red-50 wash, 200ms)
- `animate-flash-orange` — accent error flash (amber-50 wash, 200ms) — verb session
- `animate-page-in` — route transition fade+slide (200ms)
- `animate-exercise-in` — exercise card entrance (200ms)
- `animate-senda-pulse` — skeleton loading opacity pulse (1.4s, no scale); used with `senda-skeleton-fill` class (`oklch(0.145 0 0 / 0.05)` light, `oklch(0.985 0 0 / 0.07)` dark)

### API Security

- All POST routes validated with Zod v3 schemas
- CSRF protection via `validateOrigin` in `src/lib/api-utils.ts` — set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://<domain>` in Vercel env vars to enable strict mode
- `next.config.ts` — CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, `Permissions-Policy: microphone=()` globally; `/write(.*)` overrides to `microphone=(self)` for STT

### Free-Write Flow

- `/write?concept=<id>` — dedicated page; not part of SRS study queue
- `POST /api/topic` — generates prompt; Claude non-streaming, max_tokens 256
- `POST /api/grade` — grades answer; inserts `exercise_attempts` with `exercise_id: null`
- STT mic button overlaid on textarea; transcript appended with space separator; permission-denied + unsupported-browser (Firefox) fallbacks

## Backlog

Items are ordered by priority within each group. Full details of completed work in `docs/completed-features.md`.

### Observability / Infrastructure

**Infra-A: Product analytics (PostHog)** *(DONE)*

- PostHog integrated via `posthog-js` + `PostHogProvider` (wraps layout). Typed event helpers in `src/lib/analytics.ts`.
- Core events instrumented: `signup`, `login`, `exercise_submitted`, `session_completed`, `verb_drill_started`, `verb_drill_completed`. Deferred: `onboarding_complete`, `tutor_message_sent`, `free_write_submitted`, `streak_milestone`.
- Auto page-view capture enabled. User identification wired via `PostHogProvider userId` prop.
- Env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`.

**Infra-B: Error monitoring (Sentry)** *(DONE)*

- `@sentry/nextjs` integrated without `withSentryConfig()` (Turbopack-safe). Manual `Sentry.init()` in `sentry.{client,server,edge}.config.ts`.
- `src/instrumentation.ts` — Next.js 16 instrumentation hook with `onRequestError` for server/edge.
- `src/app/global-error.tsx` — App Router global error page with `Sentry.captureException`.
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` — `componentDidCatch` now reports to Sentry with React `componentStack`.
- Env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`.

**Infra-C: Database migration tooling** *(P3 — reduce manual SQL risk)*

- All migrations are currently run manually in the Supabase SQL editor. No version tracking, no rollback, no CI integration.
- Evaluate lightweight options: `supabase db push` (requires Supabase CLI), `dbmate`, or a custom `migrations` table with a simple runner script.
- **Do not implement without a PM decision on tooling and whether Supabase CLI adoption is acceptable.**

**Infra-D: A/B testing / feature flag infrastructure** *(P4 — needed before adaptive grading strategy)*

- No feature flag system exists. Required before safely rolling out adaptive grading (Ped-F) or exercise pool changes.
- Options: PostHog feature flags (if Infra-A adopts PostHog), LaunchDarkly, or simple DB-backed flags.
- **Low priority — only needed when we have features that require gradual rollout.**

### Pedagogical / Learning Quality

**Ped-J: Module 8 — Conversational & Pragmatic Markers** *(DONE)*

- 15 concepts across 4 units: Fillers & Hesitation Markers (B1, 4), Attention-Getters & Reaction Markers (B2, 5), Hedges, Justifiers & Emphatic Markers (B2, 3), Advanced Colloquial Markers & Register Switching (C1, 3).
- 135 exercises generated and seeded (+ 2 topup exercises for existing concept). All in DB.
- Distinct from Module 1 (formal written connectors) — Module 8 covers colloquial spoken discourse markers with register awareness as key pedagogy.

**Ped-F: Shared AI-generated exercise pool** *(DONE)*

- `EXERCISE_CAP_PER_TYPE = 15` per concept per type. When cap reached, random existing exercise returned (zero Claude cost).
- `exercises.source` column: `'seed'` (default) or `'ai_generated'`. Migration 018.
- `POST /api/exercises/generate` enhanced: cap check → serve cached, dedup context to Claude, post-generation dedup, `force` flag for admin bypass.
- Admin pool dashboard (`/admin/pool`): concept × type grid, "+" generate button, colour-coded counts.
- Admin exercise list: source filter + badge + delete button. Exercise detail: source badge + delete.
- `DELETE /api/admin/exercises/[id]`: hard-delete with FK ON DELETE SET NULL (preserves attempt history).
- StudySession dedup: ID-based filtering prevents duplicate exercises in auto-generate and "Generar 3 más".

**Ped-I: Concept explanation content audit** *(very low priority — content only, no code)*

- A "Concept Notes" collapsible already exists in `StudySession.tsx` showing `concept.explanation`. No new column or UI needed.
- Audit whether existing `explanation` values are concise and rule-focused enough to be useful at exercise time, or whether they are too wordy/vague.
- If poor quality: rewrite via a Claude batch script (similar to `pnpm annotate`) — no DB schema change required.
- **Do not implement until the core learning loop is stable and content quality becomes a measurable problem.**

### New Features

**Feat-F: Offline exercise packs (module download)** *(PM decision required first)*

- `gap_fill` + `sentence_builder` graded locally (accent-normalised string match); open-ended types (`translation`, `transformation`, `error_correction`) queued for AI grading on reconnect; `free_write` always excluded.
- SRS updates queued in IndexedDB, flushed when `navigator.onLine` is true; conflict resolution strategy needed.
- **Do not implement without a written PM decision on conflict resolution and sync UI.**

**Feat-G: Streak freeze / recovery mechanism** *(P2 — retention lever)*

- Users who miss a day lose their streak entirely, which is demotivating. Offer a "streak freeze" (earned or purchased) that preserves the streak for 1 missed day.
- Alternatively, offer a "streak recovery" window (e.g. complete 2× exercises within 24h of a break to restore the streak).
- Requires changes to streak logic in `POST /api/submit` and `profiles` table (e.g. `streak_freezes_remaining`).
- **Do not implement without a PM decision on the mechanic (freeze vs. recovery vs. both) and earning/purchase model.**

**Feat-H: Listening comprehension exercise type** *(P2 — new modality)*

- Add a listening exercise type where the user hears a Spanish audio clip and answers a comprehension question (e.g. gap_fill from audio, transcription, or multiple-choice).
- Could use TTS (`SpeakButton` already wired) to generate audio from existing exercise prompts, or curate dedicated audio content.
- Requires new `listening` exercise type in `ExerciseRenderer`, new component, and curriculum content.
- **Do not implement without a PM decision on audio source (TTS vs. curated) and exercise format.**

**Feat-I: i18n architecture (next-intl or JSON dictionaries)** *(P2 — future market expansion)*

- All UI strings are currently hardcoded in Spanish/English. To support additional interface languages (e.g. German, French learners of Spanish), we need an i18n framework.
- Evaluate `next-intl` (App Router native) vs. simple JSON dictionaries with a custom hook.
- **Do not implement until there is a concrete plan to support non-English interface languages.**

**Feat-J: Verb SRS integration** *(P3 — connect verbs to spaced repetition)*

- Verb conjugation drills currently track accuracy (`verb_progress`) but do not feed into the SRS system. Verbs the user struggles with should surface more frequently.
- Requires connecting `verb_progress` to `user_progress` or creating a parallel SRS loop for verbs.
- **Do not implement without a PM decision on whether verbs should share the concept SRS or have their own.**

**Feat-K: Email re-engagement (Resend / Postmark)** *(P3 — retention)*

- Users who drop off have no re-engagement mechanism. Send emails after 3, 7, and 14 days of inactivity with streak status and a "come back" CTA.
- Evaluate Resend (developer-friendly, generous free tier) or Postmark (deliverability focus).
- Requires a cron job or Supabase Edge Function to check `profiles.last_studied_date` and send emails.
- **Do not implement without a PM decision on vendor, email content, and frequency caps.**

**Feat-L: Reading comprehension / passage-based exercises** *(P4 — new modality)*

- Add longer-form reading passages with comprehension questions. Targets B2+ learners who need practice with extended text.
- Could be AI-generated or curated. Exercises would be tied to passages rather than individual concepts.
- **Future consideration — requires content strategy and new DB schema for passages.**

**Feat-M: Vocabulary feature (word-in-context)** *(P4 — new modality)*

- Dedicated vocabulary building beyond grammar concepts. Show words in context sentences, track mastery, and integrate with SRS.
- Could leverage existing `verb_sentences` pattern for vocabulary sentences.
- **Future consideration — requires PM decision on scope and differentiation from grammar exercises.**

**Feat-N: Social / accountability features** *(P4 — retention)*

- Leaderboards, study groups, or accountability partners to increase motivation and retention.
- Requires careful design to avoid toxic competition (e.g. focus on consistency rather than speed).
- **Future consideration — requires PM research on what social features actually drive retention in language apps.**

**Feat-O: Onboarding re-engagement email sequence** *(P3 — activation)*

- Users who complete signup but abandon onboarding (diagnostic quiz) never return. Send a sequence of 2–3 emails encouraging completion.
- Separate from Feat-K (which targets users who completed onboarding but stopped studying).
- Requires tracking `onboarding_completed = false` users and a transactional email provider.
- **Do not implement without Feat-K vendor decision (shared email infrastructure).**

### Bugs / Layout Fixes

**Fix-J: STT (speech-to-text) broken on free-write page — investigate and replace Web Speech API** *(high priority — iOS is primary target)*

- Current implementation uses the Web Speech API (`useSpeechRecognition.ts` / `MicButton.tsx`) which is Chromium-only (Chrome, Edge, Arc). Not supported on Safari or Firefox.
- iPhone users (Safari) cannot use dictation at all — this is a critical gap given iOS is a primary target platform.
- **Replacement candidates to evaluate**:
  1. **OpenAI Whisper API** — high accuracy on learner speech; `MediaRecorder` pattern; $0.006/min
  2. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API** — broad support; ~$0.006/15s; requires `GOOGLE_STT_API_KEY`
  3. **Claude API audio input** — see Strat-C; higher latency but no extra vendor
- **Acceptance criteria**: STT works on iOS Safari + Chrome + Edge; graceful fallback (hidden mic button) on unsupported environments.
- **Do not implement without a PM decision on vendor and cost model.**

**Fix-L: Verify push notifications on iOS PWA** *(TOOLING COMPLETE — pending device verification)*

- `pnpm push:keygen` — generates VAPID key pair (`scripts/generate-vapid-keys.ts`)
- `POST /api/push/test` — admin-only self-test endpoint; sends test notification to the caller's subscription via webpush
- `NotificationSettings` — `isAdmin` prop; when true + granted, shows "Enviar prueba" button; iOS Safari non-standalone shows PWA install hint
- `public/sw.js` — push event hardened with try/catch around `event.data.json()` for malformed payloads
- Verification checklist with developer setup instructions: `docs/ios-push-verification.md`
- Tests: `src/app/api/push/__tests__/test-push.test.ts` (5 tests), updated `NotificationSettings.test.tsx` (+4 tests)
- **Known limitation**: single `push_subscription` per profile row — only last-subscribed device gets pushes
- **Next step: deploy with VAPID env vars, run checklist on a physical iPhone (iOS 16.4+) in Safari standalone mode.**

### Technical Debt

**Debt-A: Seed script idempotency guards** *(DONE)*

- All three apply scripts are now idempotent:
  - `seed:ai:apply` (mode `new`): skips concept if `(title, unit_id)` already exists in DB.
  - `seed:ai:apply` (mode `topup`): skips exercises whose `(concept_id, type, prompt)` already exist.
  - `seed:verbs:apply`: skips combos whose `(verb_id, tense)` already have sentences in DB.
  - `seed:conjugations:apply`: already idempotent (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE on PK).
- Tests: `src/lib/curriculum/__tests__/seed-idempotency.test.ts`

### Strategic / Long-term

**Strat-C: Evaluate Claude API audio for pronunciation exercises** *(future research only)*

- Current STT (Web Speech API) is optimised for fluent native speech. For a future pronunciation exercise type, evaluate `claude-sonnet-4-6` native audio input (MP3/WAV/WebM) for combined transcription + accuracy scoring.
- Trade-offs: higher accuracy on learner speech; +1–3s latency; per-call cost; needs `/api/transcribe` + `MediaRecorder`.
- **Do not implement without a defined pronunciation exercise type and PM decision on accuracy requirements.**
